Doctrine2ORMCheatSheet
======================

Basic Doctrine2 Mapping (Annotations) Cheat Sheet in SVG, EPS and PDF formats.
Switched to SVG for easier, more freedom to design.

EPS is an intermediary step for generating the PDF file.

Margins are 0.5" and should be enough to all printers.

ToDo
----

1. Several design improvements (after all I'm a programmer and not a designer =P )
2. Include examples
3. Include Relationships (or maybe create a separate cheat sheet for it)
